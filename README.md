# üß≠ API Gateway for Microservices Architecture

This project is an **API Gateway** built with **Spring Cloud Gateway (WebMVC)** as part of a microservice-based architecture.  
It routes incoming requests to backend services (Booking and Inventory), handles **OAuth2 authentication** through **Keycloak**, provides **resilience** via **Resilience4j**, and exposes **OpenAPI** documentation for each service.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The **API Gateway** serves as a single entry point to the system.  
It acts as a reverse proxy that:
- Routes client requests to backend microservices.
- Secures endpoints using **JWT tokens** validated by **Keycloak**.
- Provides fault tolerance using **Circuit Breaker patterns**.
- Offers unified **API documentation** using **SpringDoc / OpenAPI**.
- Monitors and manages service health through **Spring Boot Actuator**.

## üß© Connected Microservices

| Service Name     | Port  | Description |
|------------------|-------|-------------|
| **Booking Service**   | `8081` | Handles booking-related operations. |
| **Inventory Service** | `8080` | Manages venue and event inventory. |

The gateway forwards requests to these services based on defined routes.

## üß© Architecture Integration

The API Gateway is part of a **5-repository microservice ecosystem**:

1. **Common** ‚Äì Shared DTOs and utilities used across services.  
2. **Booking Service** ‚Äì Handles booking operations and exposes endpoints.  
3. **Inventory Service** ‚Äì Manages venue and event stock, communicates via Kafka.  
4. **Order Service** ‚Äì Manages customer orders and coordinates with inventory and booking services.  
5. **API Gateway** ‚Äì Central entry point for all external clients, handles routing, authentication via Keycloak, and unified API documentation.

The API Gateway routes client requests to backend services, enforces security policies, and provides a single, centralized access point for the entire system.
